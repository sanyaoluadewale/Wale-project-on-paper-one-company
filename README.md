In this project I analyzed sales based on sales representative performance and customer's orders. I use range of functions, Table Expressions (CTE), the CASE statement and the GROUP BY clause. The CTE helps to create a temporary result set that can referenced within subsequent SQL statements for complex analysis. Likewise, the CASE statement was beneficial for creating conditional logic to categorize sales data based on specific criteria. GROUP BY clause was utilized in conjunction with aggregate functions to summarize sales representative data depending on the scenario. Furthermore, the project requires advanced queries to join three tables together in order to output certain desired result.  SQL can be leveraged to conduct comprehensive sales performance analysis, yielding valuable insights for business decision-making.
